This guide will walk you through installing **SwiftlyS2** on your **Counter-Strike 2 server**.

## Prerequisites

- [Latest Swiftly Release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/swiftlys2/releases) (includes both Loader and MetaMod version)
- [MetaMod Source 2.X](https://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php?branch=dev) *(Optional)*

<Callout type="note">
  SwiftlyS2 can be installed **with or without MetaMod**.  
  For most users, we recommend using the **SwiftlyS2-Loader**, as it does **not** depend on MetaMod updates and is easier to maintain.
</Callout>


## Installing SwiftlyS2

1. Download the latest [Swiftly Release](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/swiftlys2/releases) for your operating system.
2. Extract the archive. You will find two directories:
   - `/addons/swiftlys2` — the **SwiftlyS2 Loader**
   - `/addons/metamod` — the optional **MetaMod** loader
3. Copy the `/addons` directory to your server’s `/game/csgo/` folder.

<Callout type="warning">
If this is your first time installing SwiftlyS2, make sure to download the release with the `-with-runtimes` suffix.
</Callout>


## Recommended Method: SwiftlyS2-Loader

The **Loader** is the simplest and most reliable way to run SwiftlyS2.

1. Locate your `gameinfo.gi` file inside `/game/csgo/` and open it.
2. Find the line:  
   ```
   Game_LowViolence csgo_lv
   ```
   and add the following line **below** it:
   ```
   Game csgo/addons/swiftlys2
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your server.
4. Run the command `sw` in your server console to verify the installation.

<Callout type="tip">
If you previously used MetaMod to load SwiftlyS2, remove the file `addons/metamod/swiftlys2.vdf` to avoid conflicts.
</Callout>


## Alternative Method: Using MetaMod (Optional)

You can also load SwiftlyS2 through **MetaMod:Source**, but this method may break if MetaMod hasn’t been updated for the latest CS2 version.

1. Download the latest [MetaMod build](https://www.metamodsource.net/downloads.php?branch=dev) for your operating system.
2. Copy the `/addons/metamod/` directory to `/game/csgo/`.
3. Edit `gameinfo.gi` and add the line:
   ```
   Game csgo/addons/metamod
   ```
   below:
   ```
   Game_LowViolence csgo_lv
   ```
4. Restart your server and type `meta list` to verify the installation.


**You’re done!**  
SwiftlyS2 is now installed and ready to enhance your server!
