title: Database
---

SwiftlyS2 provide an unified database configuration so you don't need to write your own configuration.
The main database for SwiftlyS2 is MySQL. Ideally, if you want to use database, you should assume that the connection you are getting is a MySQL connection.

## Get a connection

Use following code to get a connection.
```csharp
IDBConnection connection = Core.Database.GetConnection("testplugin");
```
The method retrieve a connection with the key in `addons/swiftlys2/configs/database.jsonc`.
If the key is not found in configuration, it will return the default connection.

You can also use `GetConnectionString` method to get the raw connection string.

<Callout type="warning">
  The password needs to not contain the following: `@`, `:` and `/`. This is also available for username, host and database name.
</Callout>

## Use ORM to operate database

Getting a `IDBConnection` is not enough, you need to use ORM to operate database.
For example, following orm can be used:
- Dapper
- Dammel (Dapper extension)
- FreeSql
- Entity Framework Core
