## What are core events

Core events are various game events that are called from hooks, entity listener and etc. It is **not** game event.

## Listen to core event

Let's start with an example.
To register an event listener, there's two ways to do this.

<Tabs items={['With method', 'With attribute']} defaultIndex={0}>
  <Tab value="With method">
    ```csharp
    Core.Event.OnClientConnected += (@event) => {
      Console.WriteLine(@event.PlayerId);
    };
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="With attribute">
    ```csharp
    [EventListener<EventDelegates.OnClientConnected>]
    public void OnClientConnected(IOnClientConnectedEvent @event) {
      Console.WriteLine(@event.PlayerId);
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Event parameters

You probably have noticed the `@event` parameter in the example.

Generally, every event has a parameter type that holds its unique information (except OnTick).

You can view the detailed information of each field in the type interface definition, the comment is already quite intuitive.

## Destroying

If a hot reload or unload is triggered, all the event listeners will be destroyed.

## Event Delegates

`EventDelegates` is an interface that contains all event types you can listen to and their information.

Refer to [EventDelegates](/docs/api/events/eventdelegates/) for more information.
