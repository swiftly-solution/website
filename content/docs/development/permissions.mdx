## Checking Permissions

Use `Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission` to check if a player has a specific permission.

```csharp
bool hasAccess = Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.admin");

if (hasAccess)
{
    player.PrintToChat("You have admin access!");
}
```

### Wildcard Permissions

The permission system supports wildcard permissions using the `*` character. For example, `myplugin.*` grants all permissions that start with `myplugin.`.

```csharp
// Player has 'myplugin.*' permission
bool hasAdmin = Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.admin"); // true
bool hasModerate = Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.moderate"); // true
bool hasKick = Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.kick"); // true
```

## Managing Player Permissions

### Add Permission

Grant a permission to a player.

```csharp
Core.Permission.AddPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.vip");
```

### Remove Permission

Revoke a permission from a player.

```csharp
Core.Permission.RemovePermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.vip");
```

## Permission Groups

Permission groups allow you to organize permissions into reusable sets that can be assigned to players. This makes it easier to manage permissions for multiple players with similar roles.

### Configuration

Permission groups are configured in the `permissions.jsonc` file located in your server's configuration directory:

```jsonc
{
  "Permissions": {
    "Players": {
      "76561198135539332": [
        "admins"
      ],
      "76561198012345678": [
        "moderators"
      ]
    },
    "PermissionGroups": {
      "__default": [
        "basic.access"
      ],
      "admins": [
        "admin.*",
        "admin.box",
        "myplugin.admin"
      ],
      "moderators": [
        "admin.kick",
        "admin.mute",
        "myplugin.moderator"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Player Assignment

In the `Players` section, the key is the player's **SteamID64**, and the value is an array of group names that the player belongs to:

```jsonc
"Players": {
  "76561198135539332": [
    "admins"
  ]
}
```

Players can belong to multiple groups:

```jsonc
"Players": {
  "76561198135539332": [
    "admins",
    "vip"
  ]
}
```

### Default Group

The `__default` group is automatically assigned to all players. Use it to define permissions that every player should have:

```jsonc
"PermissionGroups": {
  "__default": [
    "basic.access",
    "myplugin.help"
  ]
}
```

### How Groups Work

When you use `Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission()`, the system checks:
1. Direct permissions assigned to the player via code
2. All permissions from groups the player belongs to
3. Permissions from the `__default` group

Groups support wildcard permissions, so `admin.*` in a group will grant access to all permissions starting with `admin.`.

## Sub-Permissions

Sub-permissions allow you to create hierarchical permission structures. When a player has a parent permission, they automatically gain access to all its sub-permissions.

### Add Sub-Permission

Link a sub-permission to a parent permission.

```csharp
Core.Permission.AddSubPermission("myplugin.admin", "myplugin.kick");
Core.Permission.AddSubPermission("myplugin.admin", "myplugin.ban");
Core.Permission.AddSubPermission("myplugin.admin", "myplugin.mute");
```

Now, any player with `myplugin.admin` will automatically have access to `kick`, `ban`, and `mute` permissions.

### Remove Sub-Permission

Unlink a sub-permission from a parent permission.

```csharp
Core.Permission.RemoveSubPermission("myplugin.admin", "myplugin.kick");
```

## Permission Naming Convention

It's recommended to use a consistent naming convention for your permissions:

```
plugin_name.category.action
```

Examples:
- `myplugin.admin.kick`
- `myplugin.admin.ban`
- `myplugin.vip.access`
- `myplugin.commands.special`

This makes it easier to organize and manage permissions using wildcards.

## Complete Example

```csharp
// Set up permission hierarchy
Core.Permission.AddSubPermission("myplugin.admin", "myplugin.moderator");
Core.Permission.AddSubPermission("myplugin.moderator", "myplugin.helper");

// Grant admin permission to a player
Core.Permission.AddPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.admin");

// Check permissions
if (Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.admin"))
{
    player.PrintToChat("You are an admin!");
    // This player also has moderator and helper permissions automatically
}

if (Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.moderator"))
{
    player.PrintToChat("You are a moderator!");
    // This will be true because admin includes moderator
}

// Using wildcards
Core.Permission.AddPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.commands.*");

// Now the player has all command permissions
bool canUseHelp = Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.commands.help"); // true
bool canUseAdmin = Core.Permission.PlayerHasPermission(player.SteamID, "myplugin.commands.admin"); // true
```
