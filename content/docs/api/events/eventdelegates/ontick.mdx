# Delegate EventDelegates.OnTick

<ViewSource href="https://github.com/swiftly-solution/swiftlys2/blob/master/managed/src/SwiftlyS2.Shared/Modules/Events/EventDelegates.cs#L13" />

**Namespace**: [SwiftlyS2.Shared.Events](/docs/api/events)

**Assembly**: SwiftlyS2.CS2.dll

Called when game has processed a tick. Won't be called if the server is in hibernation.
This callback is a hot path, be careful with it and don't do anything expensive.

```csharp
public delegate void EventDelegates.OnTick()
```
