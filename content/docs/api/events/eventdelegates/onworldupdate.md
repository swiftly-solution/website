# Delegate EventDelegates.OnWorldUpdate

[View Source](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/swiftlys2/blob/master/managed/src/SwiftlyS2.Shared/Modules/Events/EventDelegates.cs#L19)

**Namespace**: [SwiftlyS2.Shared.Events](/docs/api/events)

**Assembly**: SwiftlyS2.CS2.dll

Called when the world is updated. This happens even in hibernation.
This callback is a hot path, be careful with it and don't do anything expensive.

```csharp
public delegate void EventDelegates.OnWorldUpdate()
```
