- <ApiParam name="CLIENTCMD_CAN_EXECUTE" /> — IVEngineClient::ClientCmd is allowed to execute this command.
- <ApiParam name="CLIENTDLL" /> — Defined by the client DLL.
- <ApiParam name="CLIENT_CAN_EXECUTE" /> — Assigned to commands to let clients execute them.

- <ApiParam name="DEFENSIVE" /> — Defensive flag.
- <ApiParam name="DEMO" /> — Record this convar when starting a demo file.
- <ApiParam name="DEVELOPMENT_ONLY" /> — Hidden in released products. Flag is removed automatically if ALLOW_DEVELOPMENT_CVARS is defined.

- <ApiParam name="EXECUTE_PER_TICK" /> — Execute per tick.
- <ApiParam name="GAMEDLL" /> — Defined by the game DLL.

- <ApiParam name="INITIAL_SETVALUE" /> — Is set for a first convar SetValue either with its default_value or with a value from a gameinfo.
Mostly for callbacks to check for.
- <ApiParam name="LINKED_COMMAND" /> — Allows concommand callback chaining. When command is dispatched all chained callbacks would fire.
- <ApiParam name="MENUBAR_ITEM" /> — Show as a menu bar item.

- <ApiParam name="NOT_CONNECTED" /> — Cvar cannot be changed by a client that is connected to a server.
- <ApiParam name="PERFORMING_CALLBACKS" /> — Set when cvar is executing callbacks; value sets during callbacks are queued until callbacks finish.
- <ApiParam name="PER_USER" /> — Causes per-user variants (e.g. varname2..N for splitscreen) to be autogenerated.
- <ApiParam name="PROTECTED" /> — It's a server cvar, but we don't send the data since it's a password, etc.  Sends 1 if it's not bland/zero, 0 otherwise as value.

and is temporary until the actual cvar was registered.
- <ApiParam name="RELEASE" /> — Only cvars tagged with this are available to customers.
- <ApiParam name="REPLICATED" /> — Server setting enforced on clients. Values are replicated from server to clients.
- <ApiParam name="SERVER_CANNOT_QUERY" /> — If this is set, then the server is not allowed to query this cvar's value.
- <ApiParam name="SERVER_CAN_EXECUTE" /> — The server is allowed to execute this command on clients via ClientCommand/NET_StringCmd/CBaseClientState::ProcessStringCmd.
- <ApiParam name="SPONLY" /> — This cvar cannot be changed by clients connected to a multiplayer server.
