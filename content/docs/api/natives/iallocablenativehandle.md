# Interface IAllocableNativeHandle

[View Source](https://github.com/swiftly-solution/swiftlys2/blob/master/managed/src/SwiftlyS2.Shared/Natives/IAllocableNativeHandle.cs#L11)

**Namespace**: [SwiftlyS2.Shared.Natives](/docs/api/natives)

**Assembly**: SwiftlyS2.CS2.dll

Allocated handle from swiftly c++ native side.
We are using native for now to allocate objects to make use of the hl2sdk and memoverride.\

TODO: Not sure if it's a good idea to have an interface for this, because ideally there shouldn't be any difference 
between this and the `INativeHandle` from users' perspective, as allocation and destruction should be for internal use only 
and handled within the core.

```csharp
public interface IAllocableNativeHandle : INativeHandle, IDisposable
```

#### Implements

- [INativeHandle](/docs/api/natives/inativehandle)
- [IDisposable](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.idisposable)
